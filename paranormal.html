			<p>Hi! Welcome to the official website for Paranormal Lifestyle Investigations and Research. 
	At the moment, we are focusing primarily on research and are not conducting investigations. 
	That being said, we hope to provide you with all the information and up to date news you can use. </p>
	<p>We are currently working on several research projects, including a book about The Bridgewater Triangle! This is one of the biggest projects
	we've taken on to date!  We'll be including regular updates that you can find in the UPDATE: section on the sidebar.</p>
	<p>We also have basic templates for all the files and forms you and your team will need.  Included will be templates for Initial Interview Forms, Evidence Gathering and Recording Forms for both audio and visual evidence, Permission to Investigate Contracts, and Privacy Forms.</p>
	<p>On our Contacts page you'll find contact information for all of our staff including email addresses and social media pages</p>
